        Since 2018 I have been studying an <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/architecture-spatial-and-interior-design/postgraduate/m-arch-architecture-csm" target="_blank"> MA in Architecture </a> at Central Saint Martins in London. <br>
        <br>
        The work from this course that you can see on this website broadly falls into two pieces of work.<br>
        Both investigate the same corner of South East London - the area around <a href="surreycanalroad.html">Surrey Canal Road</a> <br>
        <br>
        <a href="excelsior.html">Here</a> you can find my study of an industrial estate under threat of redevelopment,and the stories of those living and working there.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="civicwaste.html">Here</a> you can find a project investigating a waste-to-energy incineration plant nearby. I imagine its reincarnation as a Civic Waste Facility.
