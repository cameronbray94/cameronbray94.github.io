        <p> <br> Car Door Sound System, 2019 <br> <br>
            A working speaker set-up using a car door donated by Dominic and Darek from London Remaps. <br>
            I added a surface transducer, so that the door itself vibrated to produce sound.<br>
            The steel frame was constructed at CSM and is designed as a trolley for portability. I took it on the tube once. <br>
            I hope to build more units to set up a genuine car door sound system as a future installation piece.
