      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="basic-wrapper">Jaar was born in New York to Chilean artist and architect Alfredo Jaar and Chilean mother Evelyne Meynard. "Jaar ascribes the melancholy in his music to the time when he moved at the age of 2 with his mother from New York to Chile."[5] In 2007, he met Gadi Mizrahi and Zev Eisenberg who ran the legendary Marcy parties in Brooklyn, New York. After hearing his early works, Mizrahi suggested 17 year-old Jaar put a 4/4 kick drum underneath his largely experimental compositions. This was Jaar's first foray into dance music, documented in his first release on Mizrahi's label Wolf & Lamb, entitled The Student. "Back then, Mizrahi says, everything D.J.'s were playing was 128 beats per minute. The stuff he was doing was almost half that speed."
        Jaar spent four years in the NY underground dance scene, crafting rough, hip hop influenced house music (like early singles Love You Gotta Lose Again and Don't Believe the Hype). During this time, Jaar made two songs where he sang in his native Spanish ("Mi Mujer" and "El Bandido"). Jaar did not intend for them to come out as they were made as jokes to make his mother laugh and dance. He changed his mind in 2010, as he felt the songs were his way of answering what he deemed as exploitative sampling of Latin American culture by white European DJs.</p>
